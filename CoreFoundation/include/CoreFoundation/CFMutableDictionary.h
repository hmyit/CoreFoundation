 * @copyright   (c) 2016, Jean-David Gadina - www.xs-labs.com
 * @discussion  CFMutableDictionary manages dynamic dictionaries. The basic
 *              interface for managing dictionaries is provided by CFDictionary.
 *              CFMutableDictionary adds functions to modify the contents of a
 *              dictionary.
 *              You create a mutable dictionary object using either the
 *              CFDictionaryCreateMutable or CFDictionaryCreateMutableCopy
 *              function. You can add key-value pairs using the
 *              CFDictionaryAddValue and CFDictionarySetValue functions.
 *              When adding key-value pairs to a dictionary, the keys and values
 *              are not copiedâ€”they are retained so they are not invalidated
 *              before the dictionary is deallocated. You can remove key-value
 *              pairs using the CFDictionaryRemoveValue function. When removing
 *              key-value pairs from a dictionary, the keys and values are
 *              released.
 *              CFMutableDictionary is "toll-free bridged" with its Cocoa
 *              Foundation counterpart, NSMutableDictionary. What this means is
 *              that the Core Foundation type is interchangeable in function or
 *              method calls with the bridged Foundation object. This means that
 *              in a method where you see an NSMutableDictionary * parameter,
 *              you can pass in a CFMutableDictionaryRef, and in a function
 *              where you see a CFMutableDictionaryRef parameter, you can pass
 *              in an NSMutableDictionary instance. This also applies to
 *              concrete subclasses of NSMutableDictionary. See Toll-Free
 *              Bridged Types for more information on toll-free bridging.
