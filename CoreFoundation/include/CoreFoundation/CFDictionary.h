 * @discussion  CFDictionary and its derived mutable type, CFMutableDictionary,
 *              manage associations of key-value pairs. CFDictionary creates
 *              static dictionaries where you set the key-value pairs when first
 *              creating a dictionary and cannot modify them afterward;
 *              CFMutableDictionary creates dynamic dictionaries where you can
 *              add or delete key-value pairs at any time, and the dictionary
 *              automatically allocates memory as needed.
 *              A key-value pair within a dictionary is called an entry. Each
 *              entry consists of one object that represents the key and a
 *              second object that is that key's value. Within a dictionary,
 *              the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary
 *              are equal (as determined by the equal callback). Internally,
 *              a dictionary uses a hash table to organize its storage and to
 *              provide rapid access to a value given the corresponding key.
 *              Keys for a CFDictionary may be of any C type, however note that
 *              if you want to convert a CFPropertyList to XML, any dictionary's
 *              keys must be CFString objects.
 *              You create static dictionaries using either the
 *              CFDictionaryCreate or CFDictionaryCreateCopy function. Key-value
 *              pairs are passed as parameters to CFDictionaryCreate. When
 *              adding key-value pairs to a dictionary, the keys and values are
 *              not copiedâ€”they are retained so they are not invalidated before
 *              the dictionary is deallocated.
 *              CFDictionary provides functions for querying the values of a
 *              dictionary. The function CFDictionaryGetCount returns the number
 *              of key-value pairs in a dictionary; the
 *              CFDictionaryContainsValue function checks if a value is in a
 *              dictionary; and CFDictionaryGetKeysAndValues returns a C array
 *              containing all the values and a C array containing all the keys
 *              in a dictionary.
 *              The CFDictionaryApplyFunction function lets you apply a function
 *              to all key-value pairs in a dictionary.
 *              CFDictionary is "toll-free bridged" with its Cocoa Foundation
 *              counterpart, NSDictionary. This means that the Core Foundation
 *              type is interchangeable in function or method calls with the
 *              bridged Foundation object. Therefore, in a method where you see
 *              an NSDictionary * parameter, you can pass in a CFDictionaryRef,
 *              and in a function where you see a CFDictionaryRef parameter, you
 *              can pass in an NSDictionary instance. This also applies to
 *              concrete subclasses of NSDictionary. See Toll-Free Bridged Types
 *              for more information on toll-free bridging.
